# Data Analyst/Science Portfolio by Ryan Porter
This portfolio is a compilation of code projects for data analysis or machine learning algorithms.

## Projects
### Boise Zoo Project 
  While doing my certificate in Data Science from Boise State University, we did a community service project with the local zoo. Zoo Boise was interested to see if their new wildlife exhibits led children to express more empathy for the animals. This study examined childrenâ€™s empathetic responses to two types of exhibits at Zoo Boise: preexisting exhibits with older interpretive features and new exhibits with updated interpretive features. Behaviors were defined and categorized based on a pre-established protocol and standardized observation instrument called the observational framework of empathetic behavior. The most challengeing part is how to convert how someone feels to data that analyzable. Zoo Boise did have a observation sheet that the observers would fill out for each of the children to help keep tracking consistent.

### San Francisco Bike Share 
  This was a final project for onr of my data science classes at Boise State University. The goal of this project is to create a model that can predict the amount of bike rides per day. I have three different datasets one with the trips, another is the stations that the bike was taken and returned to, and the final dataset is the weather for that day.

### PELT - Undergrad Research
  One of the biggest challenges in time series and sequence data is the ability to detect
multiple points of changes within that data set. Change point analysis is the process of
detecting multiple points of changes throughout time series or sequence data. There are
many different change point search methods but for this paper the focus will be on PELT
and Binary Segmentation methods. The different search methods and demonstrations of
their application with simulated and real life data sets will be explored throughout the
paper. [Link](https://github.com/porterry/Portfolio/blob/main/Notebooks/Change_Point_Porter.pdf)
