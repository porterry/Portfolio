One of the biggest challenges in time series and sequence data is the ability to detect
multiple points of changes within that data set. Change point analysis is the process of
detecting multiple points of changes throughout time series or sequence data. There are
many different change point search methods but for this paper the focus will be on PELT
and Binary Segmentation methods. The different search methods and demonstrations of
their application with simulated and real life data sets will be explored throughout the
paper. A change point package has been developed by Rebecca Killick [8] that incorporates
these methods in R which will be used for our research. [Link](https://github.com/porterry/Portfolio/blob/main/Notebooks/Change_Point_Porter.pdf)
